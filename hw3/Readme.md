Using any language/library, implement either a recurrent (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), or recursive (RecursNN) neural network model to complete a natural language processing task. The model should be a different model type than what was chosen for previous assignments. The NLP task chosen, and dataset can be the same as your course project or previous assignment. You are to write a formatted report detailing the various parameters of your implementation. Specifically, your write-up should include the following information to receive full credit:
 
1.	Description of the NLP classification task
2.	Description of the database used (# of samples, format, past uses for the database)
3.	Word embedding used (pre-trained or generated, parameters used)
4.	Network Architecture (type, layers, activation functions, total # of parameters)
5.	Training Details (objective/cost function, # of epochs, learning rate, training method (batch SGD), etc.)
6.	Performance obtained (metrics, experiment protocol used)
