Using the neural network and data used in the previous assignment, you are to apply the three methods to prevent overfitting discussed in class:

Limit the number of hidden units
Limit the size of the weights
Stop the learning before it has time to overfit

Prepare a set of experiments using a set of data not used during training to determine how each approach compares in the reduction of overfitting. Submit a formatted report of your experiments and results which include answers to the following questions:

To how many units did you reduce to for the best performance?
How did you limit the size of the weights?
How soon did you stop your training?
How many total experiments for each approach did you perform?
Which of the approaches seem to perform better for your application?
Given what you have observed in the performance, what if any conclusions can be drawn about your data and network architecture?
