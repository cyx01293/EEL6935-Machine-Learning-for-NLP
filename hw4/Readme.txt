Is this assignment you will make use of semi-supervised learning to improve the performance of a neural network when a limited amount of labeled data is available.
1.	You are to download an unlabeled text dataset which is at least 5x â€“ 10x the size of your labelled text corpus used in previous assignments.
2.	Perform semi-supervised learning using a combination of this unlabeled data and the previous labeled dataset.
3.	Compare the performance of both network architectures used in previous assignments when using supervised learning to semi-supervised learning.
In your assignment write-up you are to include the following information:
o	In your own words, provide a description of how semi-supervised learning is generally performed.
o	What NLP problem are you trying to solve?
o	Details of the two neural network architectures used. (layers, # of parameters, etc.)
o	How much labeled data is available?
o	How much unlabeled data is available?
o	Did an architecture perform significantly better than the other when using the semi-supervised approach?
